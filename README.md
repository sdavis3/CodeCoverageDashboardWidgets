# Code Coverage Dashboard Widgets
* NOTE: This works with Azure DevOps and Azure DevOps Server (Team Foundation Server). However, Microsoft requires TFS 2015 Update 3 or higher for folks using Azure DevOps Server (Team Foundation Server).

## Code Coverage Widget
This widget displays the percentage of unit test code coverage based on a selected build definition. If a build definition does not have any unit tests results recognized by the widget or if has not yet been configured, it will indicate so with a message displayed within the widget.
